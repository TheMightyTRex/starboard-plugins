# Remote access

Starboard, Jellyfin and Audiobookshelf away from home through Tailscale or Cloudflare Tunnel, with no port opened on
your router. Download apps are never shared.

A Starboard plug-in by TheMightyTRexUK, MIT licence. Needs Starboard with plug-in API 1.8 or later.

Its image is for 64-bit computers only (amd64 and arm64): Cloudflare does not make cloudflared for 32-bit Arm, so
there is no arm/v7 build for older Raspberry Pis.

## Choose a way

- **Tailscale (recommended).** Your phone joins your own private network (a tailnet), and Starboard, Jellyfin and
  Audiobookshelf answer there at an address such as `http://100.101.102.103:8095`. Nothing is open to the internet.
  It runs in userspace networking: no device, no extra rights and no change to this computer's network.
  Sign in with an auth key you make in your own Tailscale admin page (**Settings**, **Keys**), or choose
  **A sign-in link** and open the link the plug-in shows.
- **Cloudflare Tunnel.** A web address of your own, such as `https://tv.example.org`, through Cloudflare. Paste the
  tunnel token from Cloudflare's dashboard (**Networks**, **Tunnels**; the whole command is fine too). Add each
  public hostname in Cloudflare pointing at one of these, and nothing else:

  | App | Service in Cloudflare |
  |---|---|
  | Starboard | `http://localhost:8095`, protected with Cloudflare Access |
  | Jellyfin | `http://localhost:8096` |
  | Audiobookshelf | `http://localhost:13378` |

  Starboard answers only to names it knows: add the name to `STARBOARD_ALLOWED_HOSTS`. Cloudflare's terms limit how
  much video its free service carries, so use Tailscale to watch Jellyfin away from home.

## Kept safe

- Only Starboard, Jellyfin and Audiobookshelf are forwarded, each by its own small forwarder inside the plug-in.
  qBittorrent, NZBGet, SABnzbd, Reelix and the other apps are never reachable this way.
- With Cloudflare, the plug-in reads the tunnel's routes and **stops the tunnel** if any route leads anywhere else,
  to an app you have not shared, or to Starboard without Cloudflare Access.
- A key or token that is missing or wrong is said plainly on the card and in **Addresses away from home**; a token
  Cloudflare refuses stops the tunnel rather than retrying for ever.
- Keys and tokens never go on a command line or in the log. The image is pinned by digest, and the Tailscale,
  cloudflared and Python images it is built from are pinned by digest too.

## What it may do

- It sees your apps and whether they answer (`apps:read`), to find Jellyfin and Audiobookshelf.
- It reaches your home network and the internet (`network:lan`).
- It runs one container, 128 MB of memory and half a core at most. Measured on 13 November 2026: about 20 MB with
  nothing chosen, about 22 to 32 MB with Tailscale waiting to sign in, about 20 to 30 MB with Cloudflare Tunnel, and
  0.01 to 0.03% of a core at rest.

## On the dashboard

- **Away from home**: a status card with the address to use and the state.

## Settings

- **Connect with**: Nothing yet, Tailscale or Cloudflare Tunnel.
- **Addresses away from home**: each shared app's address and state, with Test.
- **Tailscale**: Sign in with (an auth key or a sign-in link), the auth key, and the name on your tailnet.
- **Cloudflare Tunnel**: the tunnel token.
- **What to share**: Starboard, Jellyfin and Audiobookshelf, each activated by default.
- Buttons: **Test remote access** and **Start remote access again**.

## Add it

In Starboard, open **Settings**, **Plug-ins**, **Add a plug-in**, and give this address:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheMightyTRex/starboard-plugins/main/remote-access/starboard-plugin.json`

Or run `python3 install.py` in this folder.

Until its image is published, the manifest names it by tag, so only Starboard's plug-in tester (development mode)
takes it: build it with `docker build -t ghcr.io/themightytrex/starboard-plugin-remote-access:1.0.0 remote-access`.
