# Notifications

Sends Starboard's events to email, Telegram, Discord, Signal, Pushover, ntfy or a webhook, in plain words, and a weekly New this week.

An example Starboard plug-in by TheMightyTRexUK, MIT licence.

## What it may do

- It sees your apps and whether they answer.
- It sees what is downloading.
- It sees your library.
- It sees processor, memory and disk use.
- It reaches your home network and the internet.
- It runs one small container (48 MB of memory at most).

## On the dashboard

- **Notifications**: a status card.
- **Notifications sent**: a list card.

## What wakes it

Starboard sends it these events: `request.available`, `download.failed`, `app.down`, `app.up`, `disk.nearly_full`, `update.available`, `item.added`.
Starboard runs its job **Send New this week on the chosen day** daily at 09:00.

### Webhooks

- **Send to webhooks**: Activate once an address is filled in and the test arrives.

### People

- **People**: One person a line: the name they use in Reelix or Seerr, a comma, then their email address or telegram and their chat id.

## How it stays light

It has no timer of its own. Starboard sends it each event and runs its daily job, and it rests (stops) 5 minutes after
the last one. A message takes about a second and 14 MB of memory while it runs.

## Secrets

Passwords, tokens, keys and the webhook addresses are secret settings: Starboard never shows them again, and the
plug-in never writes them to its log, its card or its folder. A failed message says only which channel failed and why,
in words such as "it refused the sign-in or token".

## Per person

Under **People**, give one line for each person who asks for things: the name they use in Reelix or Seerr, a comma,
then their email address, or `telegram` and their chat id. When their request is ready, they hear too.

## Signal

Signal has no official way for a server to send messages. If you already run
[signal-cli-rest-api](https://github.com/bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api) with a number registered, give its address
and that number. Otherwise leave Signal deactivated.

## Add it

In Starboard, open **Settings**, **Plug-ins**, **Add a plug-in**, and give this address:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheMightyTRex/starboard-plugins/main/notifications/starboard-plugin.json`

Or run `python3 install.py` in this folder.
