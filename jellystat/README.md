# Jellystat

Jellystat, the full watch statistics app for Jellyfin, with its own PostgreSQL database, kept apart from the main install. Opens on its own web page.

An app plug-in for Starboard (plug-in API 1.13): Jellystat runs outside the main install, in Starboard's locked-down
containers, with its own page on your home network. Starboard chooses the port (3000 when it is free) and shows the address
on the plug-in's page with **Open**.

## Who it is for

People who want every figure Jellystat gives (libraries, people, devices and a long history), and people who had Jellystat in the main install before 13 November 2026. For the usual figures, the Watch statistics plug-in is lighter: no database, and it rests when nobody looks.

## Set it up

1. Activate it. Starboard gives Jellystat your Jellyfin's address and key, so you do not type them.
2. Choose **Open Jellystat** and make Jellystat's own account (the first one is its admin).
3. Optional: **Restore a Jellystat backup**. Put a PostgreSQL backup of Jellystat's database (made with `pg_dump -Fc`) in `data/plugins/jellystat/data/main/restore` in Starboard's data folder, type its name in **Backup file to restore**, then choose **Restore the backup**. It is restored into a new database first; only when that worked is it swapped in, and the database before it is kept beside it, never deleted. Jellystat's own JSON backups are restored in Jellystat itself.

## What it may do

- It can see: Everything in Jellyfin: your library, the people who use it and what each one watched.
- It can change: Its own folder in Starboard's data (data/plugins/jellystat).
- It can change: Anything in Jellyfin: it gets Jellyfin's API key, which can change users, libraries and settings.
- It can reach: Other computers on your home network, and the internet.
- It can reach: Its own web page is opened on your home network: anyone on your home network can open it, at this computer's address and a port Starboard chooses.

It runs read only, as a user that is not root, with no extra rights, like every plug-in. Its images, pinned by digest:

- `app`: `docker.io/cyfershepard/jellystat@sha256:e61c759ec706da378bc8374e797da1dfd298ab30f804cefd82d192c301a888c7`

## At rest

What it uses when nobody is using it, measured with `tools/app_check.py` (median of 36 readings over 3 minutes, after
2 minutes to settle). A real library uses more.

| Reading | Memory | Processor (one core) |
|---|---|---|
| As Starboard runs it (hardened, empty library), 13 November 2026 | 126.4 MiB (main 14.2 MiB, app 75.3 MiB, db 36.9 MiB) | 0.22% |
| 13 November benchmark (`bench-2026-11-13/RESULTS.md`, no limits), Jellystat 71.3 and PostgreSQL 15.2 46.1 | 117.4 MiB | 0.22% |

## Removing it

**Settings**, **Plug-ins**, Jellystat, **Remove**. Its containers stop and go and its key stops working. You choose
where its folder goes, with everything it kept (settings, its database):
kept in `data/plugins/.removed`, or moved to the holding folder in **System**, **Clean up**, from where you can put it
back or delete it for good. Starboard never deletes it. Your media folder is not touched.
