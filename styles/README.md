# Styles, a Starboard plug-in

Twenty-one styles for Starboard, chosen from current interface trends and checked for accessibility in light and dark.

| Style | Look |
|---|---|
| Midnight | Dark first and dense, with calm blue accents |
| Frost | Soft frosted tints and gentle shadows, with solid panels for reading |
| Bold | Neo-brutalist: hard edges, thick shadows and a yellow highlight |
| Bento | Rounded boxes in soft pastels |
| Paper | Calm and minimal, on warm paper with a serif |
| Forest | Earthy greens and natural tones |
| Retro | Square corners, a monospace font and amber, like old terminals |
| Vivid | Bright pink and purple |
| Aurora | Deep night blue with violet and teal glows, rounded and calm |
| Nordic | Scandinavian calm: soft greys, birch white and fjord blue |
| Sunset | Warm coral and plum on soft peach |
| Graphite | Precise monochrome greys with one electric lime accent |
| Editorial | A magazine look: serif headings and a deep red rule |
| Winter | Pine and berry over a frosty page, with snow dots, glows and glass |
| Large and clear | Strong contrast, heavy headings and wide focus rings, for easy reading |
| Studio | A quiet product look: hairline borders, one indigo accent, outlined buttons |
| Expressive | Tonal colour blocks, big round shapes and pill buttons |
| Swiss | White, black and red on a grid, heavy rules and capital labels |
| Neon | Synthwave glows on a faint grid, with a gradient button |
| Clay | Puffy, matte soft-3D panels in calm pastels |
| Mica | A calm desktop look with see-through menus |

The last six reskin the whole look: cards, buttons, tabs, the header, the side menu and chips (Starboard's plug-in
API 1.2).

## Install

1. Run `python3 install.py` and give your Starboard's address. Your browser opens Settings, Plug-ins, Catalogue
   with Styles ready to add.
2. Select **Install**, read what it may do (add styles to Display, nothing else), type your Starboard password
   and select **Install Styles**.
3. Select **Activate** on its tab, then open **Display** and choose a style.

Or find Styles in Settings, Plug-ins, Catalogue. No installer? There, choose this folder's `starboard-plugin.json` under **Or its manifest file**.

## What it can and cannot change

It changes colours, corner shapes, the fonts (from fonts already on your device), shadows, the page's gradient, a light texture and glass panels. It runs nothing: no
container, no code and no network access. Starboard writes the CSS itself after checking contrast (WCAG 2.2:
4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for edges and the focus ring). High contrast, text size, spacing, underlined links and reduced
motion in Display always win over a style.

## Change it

Edit `starboard-plugin.json`, then test it: `python3 -m starboard.plugin_tester path/to/styles` from Starboard's
folder, or Settings, Plug-ins, **Test a plug-in**. A style that fails contrast cannot be added.
