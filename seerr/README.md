# Seerr

Seerr, a requests page for Jellyfin users. Reelix already has requests in Starboard, so most people do not need it.

An app plug-in for Starboard (plug-in API 1.13): Seerr runs outside the main install, in Starboard's locked-down
containers, with its own page on your home network. Starboard chooses the port (5055 when it is free) and shows the address
on the plug-in's page with **Open**.

## Who it is for

People whose Jellyfin users already know Seerr's request page. Reelix already has requests in Starboard (Downloads, Requests), so most people do not need it.

## Set it up

1. Activate it, choose **Open Seerr**, and sign in with your Jellyfin account; its set-up asks for Jellyfin's address (`http://host.docker.internal:8096`) and your libraries.
2. If you also use Reelix's requests, choose one place for people to ask, so requests are not made twice.

## What it may do

- It can change: Its own folder in Starboard's data (data/plugins/seerr).
- It can reach: Other computers on your home network, and the internet.
- It can reach: Its own web page is opened on your home network: anyone on your home network can open it, at this computer's address and a port Starboard chooses.

It runs read only, as a user that is not root, with no extra rights, like every plug-in. Its images, pinned by digest:

## At rest

What it uses when nobody is using it, measured with `tools/app_check.py` (median of 36 readings over 3 minutes, after
2 minutes to settle). A real library uses more.

## Removing it

**Settings**, **Plug-ins**, Seerr, **Remove**. Its containers stop and go and its key stops working. You choose
where its folder goes, with everything it kept (settings):
kept in `data/plugins/.removed`, or moved to the holding folder in **System**, **Clean up**, from where you can put it
back or delete it for good. Starboard never deletes it. Your media folder is not touched.
