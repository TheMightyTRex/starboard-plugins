# Navidrome

Navidrome, a music server for Subsonic apps on phones and in the car. It reads your music folder and never changes it.

An app plug-in for Starboard (plug-in API 1.13): Navidrome runs outside the main install, in Starboard's locked-down
containers, with its own page on your home network. Starboard chooses the port (4533 when it is free) and shows the address
on the plug-in's page with **Open**.

## Who it is for

People who listen to their music on a phone, offline or in the car, with a Subsonic app such as Symfonium, Substreamer, Amperfy or play:Sub. Jellyfin also plays music; Navidrome is for these apps.

## Set it up

1. Activate it, choose **Open Navidrome** and make the first account, which is its admin.
2. It reads `media/music`, read only. In your Subsonic app, use the address Starboard shows, such as `http://192.168.1.20:4533`.

## What it may do

- It can see: Files in your media folder under music (read only).
- It can change: Its own folder in Starboard's data (data/plugins/navidrome).
- It can reach: Other computers on your home network, and the internet.
- It can reach: Its own web page is opened on your home network: anyone on your home network can open it, at this computer's address and a port Starboard chooses.

It runs read only, as a user that is not root, with no extra rights, like every plug-in. Its images, pinned by digest:

## At rest

What it uses when nobody is using it, measured with `tools/app_check.py` (median of 36 readings over 3 minutes, after
2 minutes to settle). A real library uses more.

## Removing it

**Settings**, **Plug-ins**, Navidrome, **Remove**. Its containers stop and go and its key stops working. You choose
where its folder goes, with everything it kept (settings):
kept in `data/plugins/.removed`, or moved to the holding folder in **System**, **Clean up**, from where you can put it
back or delete it for good. Starboard never deletes it. Your media folder is not touched.
