# Audio description tracks

Adds a description track you already have, such as one from AudioVault, to the film or episode in Jellyfin it belongs
to. It checks that the track and the film are the same length first, so a track made for another cut of the film is
never added by mistake.

A Starboard plug-in by TheMightyTRexUK, MIT licence. It goes with the [Audio description](../audio-description/)
plug-in, whose **Search AudioVault** list links to AudioVault's own search for each title without audio description.

## How to use it

1. Get the track yourself, for example from AudioVault after signing in there. Keep to its rules: 25 downloads a day
   for each account.
2. Put the file in the **audio-description** folder in your media folder, next to the movies and tv folders, or upload
   it on the plug-in's **Description tracks to add** page (up to 60 MB). MP3, M4A and the like work, and so does a
   zip of them, as AudioVault gives series.
3. Name it as the film and its year, such as `Dune (2021).mp3`, or a series with its episode, such as
   `Slow Horses S01E03.mp3`. When more than one title could match, choose the right one on the page.
4. The plug-in checks the lengths. When they agree, within 5 seconds unless you change it, it adds the track next to
   the film as `Dune (2021).Audio Description.eng.mka`, named **English (Audio Description)**, and asks Jellyfin to
   read the film again.
5. Play the film in Jellyfin, choose the English (Audio Description) sound track, and say on the page whether it
   plays in step. Yes moves the original to the **Confirmed** folder; No moves the added track to **Taken off**.

## When the lengths differ

A description track is made for one cut of a film. A different length, by more than a few seconds, almost always means
your copy is another cut: an extended edition, a director's cut, a version with different studio logos at the start, or
a broadcast with its own credits. The plug-in says how much longer or shorter the track is and does not add it.
Look for a track for your cut, or line the track up yourself with describealign
(<https://pypi.org/project/describealign/>), then put the result in the folder.

## What it may do

- It uses Jellyfin's key, which Starboard keeps: to search for the title and to ask Jellyfin to read it again.
- It reaches your home network, where Jellyfin is.
- It can add files in your media folder under movies and tv (the new sound tracks, next to their films) and under
  audio-description (its own folder). It runs as the owner of your media folder, so those files are yours.
- It runs one container (96 MB of memory at most) that rests when it is not needed. mkvmerge, from MKVToolNix, runs
  only while a track is checked or added, a few seconds each, copying the sound as it is without converting it.

## What it never does

- Download from, or read pages of, any website, AudioVault included.
- Change the film's own file.
- Delete anything. It moves files to **Confirmed**, **Taken off** and **Unzipped** inside the audio-description folder,
  and you delete them there when you like.

## Settings

- **Description tracks to add**: each file in the folder, what it was matched to, and what happened.
- **Language of the description tracks**: English unless you change it. The track is named after it.
- **How close the lengths must be**: 5 seconds unless you change it, from 1 to 30.
- **Look in the folder now**: it also looks when its page opens, and once a night in quiet hours.

## Add it
