# Watch statistics

What was watched, by whom and when, and the top titles, from Jellyfin's Playback Reporting, with no second database.

An example Starboard plug-in by TheMightyTRexUK, MIT licence.

## What it may do

- It uses Jellyfin's key, which Starboard keeps.
- It reaches your home network and the internet.
- It runs one small container (64 MB of memory at most).

## On the dashboard

- **Plays this week**: a stat card.
- **Top titles**: a list card.
- **Who watched most**: a list card.
- **Watch statistics source**: a status card.

## In its section of Settings, Plug-ins

- **Recent plays**: a table to read.
- **Top titles**: a table to read.
- **People**: a table to read.

## Settings

- **Over the last**
- **Leave out these people**: One Jellyfin user name a line, such as an account for testing.

## Playback Reporting

The figures come from [Playback Reporting](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-plugin-playbackreporting), a plug-in
for Jellyfin in its official catalogue. Add it in Starboard's **Settings**, **Jellyfin**, or in Jellyfin's
**Dashboard**, **Plugins**, **Catalogue**, then restart Jellyfin. It counts from then on, and keeps its own history
inside Jellyfin's data, so nothing else needs a database.

Without it, this plug-in says so on its tables and its **Watch statistics source** card, and shows what Jellyfin knows
itself: each person's last play of each title, with no device or time watched.

## In place of Jellystat

Jellystat needs two containers and PostgreSQL (about 60 MB measured on a small server, 150 to 250 MB on a busy one).
This plug-in rests when no one is looking, and uses about 14 MB for a few seconds when a card or table asks.

## Add it

In Starboard, open **Settings**, **Plug-ins**, **Add a plug-in**, and give this address:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheMightyTRex/starboard-plugins/main/watch-stats/starboard-plugin.json`

Or run `python3 install.py` in this folder.
